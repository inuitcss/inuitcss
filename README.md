**Extensible, scalable, Sass-based, OOCSS framework for large and long-lasting
UI projects.**

inuitcss is a framework in its truest sense: it does not provide you with UI and
design out of the box, instead, it provides you with a solid architectural
baseline upon which to complete your own work.

## Installation

You can use inuitcss in your project by installing it using a package manager
(recommended):

**npm:**

```
$ npm install --save-dev inuitcss
```

**Bower:**

```
$ bower install --save-dev inuitcss
```
