## [6.0.0] - 2018-02-26

### Breaking changes
- Change the way `inuitcss` deals with the baseline grid, as part of improving the vertical rhythm generated by the `inuit-font-size` mixin. It includes changes to the mixin and some core variables [[#291](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/291)]
- Responsive spacings are off by default, now. If you used the class `.u-margin-bottom-none@[BREAKPOINT]` as the only responsive spacing class in your markup, please make sure that the respective CSS is still generated. If it's not, please define the according classes as follows in your Sass:
```scss
$inuit-responsive-spacing-directions: (
  "-bottom": "-bottom",
);

$inuit-responsive-spacing-properties: (
  "margin": "margin",
);

$inuit-responsive-spacing-sizes: (
  "-none": 0
);
```
If you already altered your responsive spacings in any way, you don't have to worry. [[#312](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/312)]

- `.o-crop` and `.o-ratio` objects now receive user defined strings for the ratio modifiers class names. [[#346](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/346)]
- `.o-crop` and `.o-ratio` objects now support decimals as ratios (e.g. `1.618:1` etc.). [[#276](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/276)]
- Add more positioning modifier classes for the crop object. [[#298](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/298)]

## [6.0.0-beta.3] - 2016-08-30

### Breaking changes
- `_settings.global.scss` is renamed to `_settings.core.scss`.   
The rather opinionated example variables `$inuit-global-radius` and `$inuit-global-transition` are transfered to the new `_example.settings.global.scss` file and renamed to `$global-radius` and `$global-transition`. [[#83](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/83)]
- The `hidden-visually` mixin is now prefixed with `inuit-`. Call the mixin with `@include inuit-hidden-visually();` from now on. [[#105](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/105)]
- The default fractions for the widths-classes have changed. [[#101](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/101)]   
    We now provide:   
    - `1/1`
    - `1/2`, `2/2`
    - `1/3`, `2/3`, `3/3`
    - `1/4`, `2/4`, `3/4`, `4/4`
    - `1/5`, `2/5`, `3/5`, `4/5`, `5/5`    
    If you use classes with a `x/12` or `x/16` fraction like `u-6/12` or `u-4/16` in your markup and you don't want to change these classes accordingly in your HTML, you can generate the appropriate widths-classes you need by altering the `$inuit-fractions` Sass list (in yout main Sass stylesheet):   
    ```scss
    $inuit-fractions: 1 2 3 4 5 12 16 !default;
    @import "utilities/utilities.widths";
    ```
- The reverse modifier of the flag objects is renamed from `.o-flag-rev` to `.o-frag--reverse`. [[#114](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/114)]
- Split the `_tools.functions.scss` and `_tools.mixins.scss` files into individual files. [[#5](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/5)]   
    Alter the import of these files in your Sass main stylesheet as follows:
    ```scss
    @import "tools/tools.rem";
    @import "tools/tools.font-size";
    @import "tools/tools.clearfix";
    @import "tools/tools.hidden";
    ```
- Remove `inuit-halve` Sass function. [[#5](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/5)]
- Remove `inuit-hocus` Sass function. [[#5](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/5)]
- Remove `_tools.widths.scss` file and integrate its content into `_utilities.widths.scss`. [[#117](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/117)]   
    This means that you have to remove the import of the tools file in your Sass main stylesheet.
- Put offsets (i.e. push and pull classes) behind a feature switch. [[#104](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/104)]   
    If you use `u-push-` and/or `u-pull-` classes, switch them on in your Sass main stylesheet:
    ```scss
    $inuit-offsets: true;
    @import "utilities/utilities.widths";
    ```

### New features
- Add [Sass MQ](https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq) as default media-query management tool. [[#80](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/80)]
- Add table object. [[#97](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/97)]
- Add pack object. [[#98](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/98)]
- Add new button variations for the example button component.
- Add `CONTRIBUTING` file. [[#14](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/14)]
- Provide `box-sizing: border-box;` for layout object by default to make dependency of generic.box-sizing partial obsolete. [[#89](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/89)]



## [6.0.0-beta.2] - 2016-07-19

### New features
- Add flag object. [[#76](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/76)]
- Ability to pass `!important` as argument for the font-size mixin. [[#54](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/54)]

### Fixes
- Heading utilities font-sizes are now declared with `!important`. [[#54](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/54)]
- Fix `.o-layout--small`. The `.o-layout--small`s `margin-left` property was set to a positive value rather than a negative value which caused the layout container to be unintentionally indented on the x-axis. [[#84](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/84)]

### Minor changes
- Add missing rule to `html` element to prevent page jumps. [[#77](https://github.com/inuitcss/inuitcss/issues/77)]
